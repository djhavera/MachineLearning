    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted.

With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: ** I believe the best model to predict individuals that make more than \\$50,000 is a Random Forest (RF). Support Vector Machines (SVMs) would also be a great choice but their training time is a huge negative as it is exponentially higher than Random Forests or Naive Bayes (NB).  I even attempted multiple kernels with SVMs (Poly, RBF, and Linear) but these scenarios did not significantly reduce training time compared to NB and RF.  RFs are a better choice versus NB because of a far superior accuracy score as illustrated in the charts above.  I believe the low accuarcy for NB can be attributed to the Naive nature of the algorithm that it treats all variables as independent.  In the case of our dataset, it is highly likely that capital gain and hours worked are dependent on education level.  Finally, RFs are a very versitile algorithm and require very little tweaking.  They will be a great choice for our dataset because they can identify the most critical variables that can predict an individuals ability to make more than \\$50k.  RFs can overfit when the data sample is small but in our case with over 36k samples we have limited risk of overfitting.  We can see this trend in the accuracy of the training set graph, which illustrates that a training sample of 1% and 10% of the data was too small for RFs as it led to an accuracy score over 98%.  The accuracy dropped to around 90% when all the data was used.\n"

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests (RF) are an ensemble method, which in layman's terms means that the model will run numerous trial and error scenarios (weak learners).  Ensemble methods evaluate outcomes from each scenario and incorporate them into an optimal approach (strong learner) to the problem. RFs are based on decision trees which are built using recursive partitioning.  To create a decision tree, a root is created and for example a question could be asked:  Does the individual make more than \\$50k?  If YES proceed to the left hand side of the tree and if NO proceed to the righthand side.  This process is repeated recursively and more decision points are created down each side of the tree until ultimately all features have been explored.  Since this can result in a very big tree structure, decision trees use criteria such as information gain to determine whether or not a tree should be made deeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "A RF will build a forest of random decision trees by randomly choosing initial variables to build the decision tree.  RFs then make a final prediction based on the forest of trees (for example the final prediction could be the mean of each prediction.)  RFs enable several variables to be evaluated at the same time and a high number of observations to be used in the forecast.  RFs enable us to leverage the benefits of decision trees to a large scale and to randomly select variables that we may not have considered.  For this reason, they offer and excellent solution to our problem of predicting individuals making more than \\$50k.\n",

    "It's fascinating that only one of my top 5 (capital -gains) from question 6 is in the graph above.  I believe this shows that my initial thoughts were biased based on my own experience.  This highlights an important learning that it is critical to use feature importance to validate preliminary thoughts regarding a data set, so that the model doesn't become biased.  I think that age and hours-per week are definitely revelant because the more you work, the more money you can earn.  Additionally, being married offers tax breaks and being a male capitalizes on a gender bias that men do earn more in the workplace.  Plus, after getting married, a worker has has more motivation to earn a high income to take care of the family."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "\n",
    "I absolutely would use only five features in the final model versus the thirteen features in the complete data set. Using only 5 features only dropped the accuracy by a few percentage points from 86% to 81% and the F-score decreased from 74% to 63%. I think this decrease is an acceptable trade off given using a smaller feature set.  Plus for every feature we use in the model, we face the curse of dimensionality and need to have expotential data to have a meaningful impact on the prediction.  Finally, if I were to use an algorithm like SVM, then using only five features could greatly reduce the amount of training time necessary, which in turn would overcome one of this algorithm's greatest weaknesses.
