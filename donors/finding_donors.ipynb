    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted.

With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling is important because machine learning algorithms may not perform well if the features have vastly different scales. For example, a feature like age, typically in the range of 0-100, could be considered less important than capital-gain, which might have values in the thousands or more, by some algorithms. Normalization ensures that all features have the same scale and thus contribute equally to the algorithm's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular case, the MinMaxScaler from sklearn is used, which scales the features to lie in a given range, typically between 0 and 1. The formula used by the MinMaxScaler is:\n",
    "\n",
    "scaled_value = (value - min) / (max - min)\n",
    "\n",
    "After scaling, the dataset will have the same shape of the distribution for each feature, but the values will be adjusted to fall within the scaled range. Note that once the data is scaled, the original values are no longer the same, and interpreting the data requires considering the scaling applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "\n",
    "1. **Naive Bayes (NB)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Real-world application:**\n",
    "        - Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification (like classifying emails as spam or not spam).\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Strengths and when it performs well:**\n",
    "        - Fast training and prediction times, making it scalable for larger datasets.\n",
    "        - Not sensitive to irrelevant features, as they don’t affect the model’s performance significantly.\n",
    "        - Good performance when dealing with categorical or discrete data, especially in text classification.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Weaknesses and when it performs poorly:**\n",
    "        - Assumes that features are conditionally independent, which is rarely the case in real-life data (hence \"naive\").\n",
    "        - May not perform well with continuous features or when the features have significant interactions.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**\n",
    "        - Naive Bayes can handle the large number of features in this dataset efficiently, and since it is based on probabilities, it can offer insight into the underlying probabilities of an individual making more than $50,000 based on their features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Real-world application:**\n",
    "        - Handwriting recognition, Image classification, and predicting diseases such as breast cancer.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Strengths and when it performs well:**\n",
    "        - Effective in high-dimensional spaces, even when the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "        - Versatile as different Kernel functions can be used for the decision function (Linear, Polynomial, Radial basis function, Sigmoid, etc.).\n",
    "        - Works well when there is a clear margin of separation in the data.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Weaknesses and when it performs poorly:**\n",
    "        - Not efficient on large datasets as the training time can grow exponentially with the size of the dataset.\n",
    "        - Doesn’t directly provide probability estimates.\n",
    "        - Can be sensitive to noisy data (overfitting).\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**\n",
    "        - SVM might be effective here as the dataset has a high-dimensional feature space. SVM's ability to use kernel tricks can capture complex relationships in the data without having to perform difficult transformations on our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random Forest (RF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Real-world application:**\n",
    "        - Used in various fields such as banking, stock market, medicine, and e-commerce. For example, in medicine, it can be used for identifying diseases based on symptoms.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Strengths and when it performs well:**\n",
    "        - Good for handling large data sets with higher dimensionality.\n",
    "        - Can handle missing values and maintains accuracy for missing data.\n",
    "        - Can evaluate the importance of features within the dataset.\n",
    "        - Reduces overfitting compared to individual decision trees because it averages the results from multiple trees.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Weaknesses and when it performs poorly:**\n",
    "        - Random forests have been observed to overfit for some datasets with noisy classification/regression tasks.\n",
    "        - Unlike decision trees, the results are not easily interpretable.\n",
    "        - May take longer to train than other models due to constructing multiple trees.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**\n",

    "**Answer: ** I believe the best model to predict individuals that make more than \\\\$50,000 is a Random Forest (RF). Support Vector Machines (SVMs) would also be a great choice but their training time is a huge negative as it is exponentially higher than Random Forests or Naive Bayes (NB).  I even attempted multiple kernels with SVMs (Poly, RBF, and Linear) but these scenarios did not significantly reduce training time compared to NB and RF.  RFs are a better choice versus NB because of a far superior accuracy score as illustrated in the charts above.  I believe the low accuarcy for NB can be attributed to the Naive nature of the algorithm that it treats all variables as independent.  In the case of our dataset, it is highly likely that capital gain and hours worked are dependent on education level.  Finally, RFs are a very versitile algorithm and require very little tweaking.  They will be a great choice for our dataset because they can identify the most critical variables that can predict an individuals ability to make more than \\$50k.  RFs can overfit when the data sample is small but in our case with over 36k samples we have limited risk of overfitting.  We can see this trend in the accuracy of the training set graph, which illustrates that a training sample of 1% and 10% of the data was too small for RFs as it led to an accuracy score over 98%.  The accuracy dropped to around 90% when all the data was used.\n"

    "### Question 4: Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests (RF) are a type of ensemble learning method, which in layman's terms means that the model is like a committee that makes decisions based on numerous trial-and-error scenarios. Instead of relying on the judgment of a single decision model, it incorporates outcomes from each scenario into an optimal approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests use Decision Trees as the fundamental building blocks. Imagine Decision Trees as flowcharts with a series of questions and answers that ultimately lead to a decision. For example, the first question could be \"Does the individual make more than $50k?\". If YES, proceed to the next question on the left side, if NO, proceed to the right side. The tree keeps branching like this until it reaches a final decision. To avoid overly complex trees that do not generalize well, Decision Trees employ certain criteria such as information gain to determine when to stop growing the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a tree structure is mathematically known as a Binary Tree. It's a hierarchical structure that starts with a single root and branches out in two directions, left and right. Each branch represents an outcome of a condition or question, much like a flowchart.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Characteristics (Binary Trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary trees are incredibly efficient for search, access, insertion, and deletion operations. The efficiency comes from the way elements are organized in the tree, which allows the algorithm to skip over large portions of the data. The time complexity for search, access, insertion, and deletion is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree. This means that as the size of the tree doubles, the maximum number of steps needed only increases by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Random Forests, binary trees are primarily used for making decisions based on the features of the data. Each node in the tree corresponds to a feature, and branches represent different outcomes, leading to the leaves that contain the final decision or classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how a simple binary tree can be structured in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        self.left = None\n",
    "        self.right = None\n",
    "\n",
    "class BinaryTree(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, root):\n",
    "        self.root = Node(root)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Decision Tree\n",
    "A decision tree is a slightly different variation of a binary tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splitting criteria: Decision trees use criteria such as entropy, Gini impurity, or mean squared error to decide which feature to split on at each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature and threshold: In decision trees, each internal node tests a particular feature and a threshold (e.g., is age > 30?). Depending on the test, an instance is routed down the left or right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leaf nodes with decisions: The leaf nodes in decision trees typically represent a decision or an output class, and not just values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pruning: Decision trees usually involve a pruning process to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class DecisionTreeNode(object):\n",

When it comes to making a final decision, the Random Forest considers the decisions of all the individual trees. Think of it like each tree casting a vote for the final outcome.\n",

    "What makes Random Forests so powerful is that by using multiple trees, they manage to iron out the individual biases and errors from each tree. This way, even though a single tree might not be very accurate on its own, the collective decision of the forest tends to be much more reliable and robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of predicting whether individuals make more than $50k, Random Forests enable us to evaluate multiple variables at the same time and use a large number of observations efficiently. This makes them an excellent solution for solving complex prediction problems such as this one.\n",

    "It's fascinating that only one of my top 5 (capital -gains) from question 6 is in the graph above.  I believe this shows that my initial thoughts were biased based on my own experience.  This highlights an important learning that it is critical to use feature importance to validate preliminary thoughts regarding a data set, so that the model doesn't become biased.  I think that age and hours-per week are definitely revelant because the more you work, the more money you can earn.  Additionally, being married offers tax breaks and being a male capitalizes on a gender bias that men do earn more in the workplace.  Plus, after getting married, a worker has has more motivation to earn a high income to take care of the family."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "I absolutely would use only five features in the final model versus the thirteen features in the complete data set. Using only 5 features only dropped the accuracy by a few percentage points from 86% to 81% and the F-score decreased from 74% to 63%. I think this decrease is an acceptable trade off given using a smaller feature set.  Plus for every feature we use in the model, we face the curse of dimensionality and need to have expotential data to have a meaningful impact on the prediction.  Finally, if I were to use an algorithm like SVM, then using only five features could greatly reduce the amount of training time necessary, which in turn would overcome one of this algorithm's greatest weaknesses.
